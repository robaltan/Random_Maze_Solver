# Random Maze Solver
A Reinforcement Learning agent, programmed in Python, that utilizes Double Q-Learning, 
Prioritized Experience Replay Buffer, and Early Stopping to solve a random maze. 

## Required Libraries

* PyTorch
* NumPy

## Testing

To see how your agent performs, you should run the following command for the graphics package. In this way, you could see how your agent is performing in 600 seconds (relatively 10 minutes). It's useful to see the behavior of your agent.

```bat
python train_and_test.py
```
